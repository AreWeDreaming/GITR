1. replace hardcoded urls with ORNL-Fusion urls
2. build hdf5 manually
3. Get netcdf to link to the hdf5 you built
4. ensure that the dependent projects use the same CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER as the one
   installed.
5. Write Mac install instructions.
6. Get it to build on a mac.
7. Push all that stuff to dev.
8. rebase the unit tests branch off of dev, let Tim know so he can work on it.

9. Setup CI runs in another branch - this should probably be your topic branch for next
