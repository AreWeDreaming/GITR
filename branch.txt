Purpose of this branch:

1. Change cmake generator to ninja in progress (done)
2. add "clean" command to delete what's not external ( done )
3. Checks to not rebuild all of external every time done
4. updated documentation to describe 2 workflows:
   managed (with spack) or unmanaged (build everything yourself)
5. Make build system re-entrant - should be able to clean and rebuild without issue done



test for existence of final output files - if not found, build, if found, leave. This
should make the system re-entrant.

then, see about removing the "find" modules for all except netcdf - that one can be taken later
when the dependency is removed

first remove the find_packages, since the result variables are all you care about

then check for existence as the reentrance test. Test out the clean/reentrance stuff

then try out ninja as a generator - add instructions for that too

Then update the documentation to indicate all these things you've discovered

Then attempt to install this on fusiont5 or fusiont6
