The purpose of this branch is to reapply the changes from runtime_config in a testable
manner and ensure correct results.

First, declare all variables and add them to all the functions that will need them.

how do I find them? Well, diff all the changes and look or I guess. If there is a
use.get() anywhere, propagate it on down through the codebase.

Hook in all the variables first, then remove use3dtetgeom and usecylsymm for starters.
Then test this on fusiont6.

Next, you'll need to go delete all the duplicate entries and ensure that this can actually
compile. Then you'll start propagating each variable to the correct function call!

There are 35 of them. I see no reason why you can't do 7 commits, 5 per commit.

Then you need to go through and change
