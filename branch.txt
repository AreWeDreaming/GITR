Purpose of this branch:

1. Change cmake generator to ninja
2. add "clean" command to delete what's not external
3. Checks to not rebuild all of external every time
4. updated documentation to describe 2 workflows:
   managed (with spack) or unmanaged (build everything yourself)
5. Make build system re-entrant - should be able to clean and rebuild without issue
